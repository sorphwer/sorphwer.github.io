# Introduction

Keats is an English Romantic poet in 18th century ,more precisely , lived between 1795 to 1821. When I was 14 , I read an isolated stanza from "*Ode to a Nightingale*" translated into Chinese in my textbook . And in that weekend , I bought a collection of his poems , with both original English version and Chinese translation. Since then ,Shakespeare's and Keats' sonnets have influenced me deeply . This essay is about figuring out how Keats' internal mind would be , and how his sonnets effected me .

# A Romantic Poet

One of the main features in John Keats' poems is to use various imageries from nature, in a figurative language with multiplicity.  Keats especially emphasized the "sensation" in his poem , like vision , hearing ,smell ,and many other visual subjective sense . For example , at the first line of  *Ode to a Nightingale*: "*My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains*" , we can easily discover that he started to express sensations. I supposed that one of the reasons why "*Ode to a Nightingale* " is an eternal poem is that the feelings presented are full of such multiplicity . From the sound of the bird's song to the flavor of wine , and the smells of various flowers , the expression that the poet given us was not limited in a single pattern ,and he showed us a not only real but also colorful world.

As the a key idea in Romantic poetry , the main theme of Keats' poems is to praise the beauty and "sublime" of the world , like satisfactory existence in wild nature like "*The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft; And gathering swallows twitter in the skies."(To Autumn)*，and subjective substance with pleasure like sleep :*"O soothest Sleep! If so it please thee, close,In midst of this thine hymn, my willing eyes..."(To Sleep)* , these are the mostly usual themes of Keats' poems.

Keats' poem told me to observe the feelings and emotions of ourselves , and write them down as naturally as possible. By borrowing many imageries and sensation description , I have found that it's much easier to organized a plentiful paragraph in my daily writing. To archive all above , I have to sense the nature world as if I am at a kid's view , with intuitive only.  

# One's Death and Love

What would be his answer if we asked him "What is your view about death ?". And I can sense , if I were him , I would answer : "Don't think too much , just enjoy current breeze." .I believed that Keats once expressed his view towards Death , and we can find something really important in the poem he wrote during 1818 and 1819 . The first poem I am going to quote is "*The Human Seasons*" where he wrote "*He hath his Winter too of pale Misfeature, Or else he would forget his mortal nature.*" It is very dramatic that he would be exactly the man who "forget his mortal nature." , for he would die soon in 1820 , in about two years, thus , there shall be no 'winter period' in his whole life. And over same period , he wrote "*Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,  And so live ever—or else swoon to death."(Bright star)*( though It is unclear when Keats first drafted "Bright Star" according to wikipedia , I guessed the first version was written earlier than 1818. )  Keats finally revised this sonnet for his lover, Fanny Brawne. I believed he wrote the last line of *Bright Star* for himself.  In this aspect , it just like that he has dramatically wrote down what he will do if he was 'really' dying. 

As we know , there're basically two main views of death , dualist view(human's mental substance is independent) and physically view(Soul and body are indiscrete) , according to Shelly Kagan in Yale , and Keats might believe in latter . In a sense , if he lived without any pleasure , he would rather choose to die.

The ending of Keats reminds me of *The Faerie Queene* by Spencer , which also influenced Keats very well , but just like Keats himself , they all still had too much to say. (*The Faerie Queene* is undone with about 10 chapters left) Judging from the original occupation of Keats ——a surgeon ,  I do not think that he feared death . On the contrary , he regard death as a simple ending , just like a poem 's last line. He thought he did make some good things for the whole world as a surgeon , and this faith has transferred into myself while reading all his poems about love and death . Those words makes me think what if I lose my life and love , and impels me to do some good things for our world .

# Literature  and Medicine 

Another poem by Keats that impressed me deeply is "*Isabel*"， whose story-telling in such a huge length with unchanged high quality and structure . Over that last period of his life, the theme of Keats is remained eternal things like love , stars and changing seasons .In the end he got tuberculosis , and was separated from his lover , which made his style turned gloomy and dark. I believe that he must have thought over the meaning of life and love , and the memory of all his life as a doctor .However , Keats did not present an obvious feeling of despair . I assume that on the one hand , he was a romantic poet , who had an intuitive feeling to be chosen to guide others, on the other hand , he kept an unique concept of value  , that he had a reasonable view toward the meaning of life , because of his experiences as a surgeon. 

Therefore , we can draw such a conclusion that a romantic like Keats is not always 'romantic' , for the reality that everyone is going to die , and the a part of the world is cruel. As for me , I found myself facing a same question : We recognize that we live to discover the beauty of the world , should we keep reminding ourselves that eventually we have to suffer ? Pointedly we have to chose our attitude to our life , or we will be puzzled wondering what we live for. 

# To Be Famous , Or Not To Be

I am pretty sure Keats desire to become a great poet at the beginning , he learnt and wrote poem , contributed them to others , and was satisfied if his poem was published ——he even did not care about criticism. But during the late period of life,Keats wrote drafts of a poem like *Ode to a Nightingale* in slips , and just cluttered them into the bookshelf. Those slips were found by his friend and finally became poems. So what had changed him? If we regard his short life as a sonnet , then I think the illness and the experiences in countryside may be the 'volta'. As we know , his epitaph is "Here lies one whose name was written in water" , written by himself. Is it a concession ?  I think so,  while I do not recognize he was upset for his works . On the contrary , he clearly knew how great his works were , and he enjoyed being a good poet . It seems like he never give up until he got illness .  I believe he have decided to accept everything peacefully in the end.

All the things above make me consider if to be famous was really worthwhile , especially when I have realized how big the stage of the world was . As for me ,  making some things with goodwill should be a better way to live , Just like a nightingale.

# Conclusion 

Without doubt  Keats is a great poet , who has a short but colorful life .When we scanning the story of his entire life , we will discover a man with enthusiasm to poetry , and passion to love .He learnt , he loved , he got much famousness , he got illness , and then he died .He is a man in 18 century, like other poets , he wrote many poems , but what else remained ? I would answer that he let us to focus on the Nightingales on trees —— something tiny but beautiful in our daily life , that was ignored . We have almost lost the ability to appreciate natural pleasure in modern society. And romantic in 1800s , can drive us to re-regard this question. Keats is died , but his nightingale is still singing , which will be the significance of so-called romanticism.
