# Review

##  1. <a name='FiveLayers'></a>Five Layers

The internet communication protocol system ( aka internet protocol stack) is organized with **Layering** scheme , which includes **5** layers : `Application`,`Transport`,`Network`,`Link`,`Physic`,(from up to down ). The fist part of this note will be composited by 5 corresponding part called **Application Layer , Transport Layer , Data Plane , Control Plane , Link Layer and LANS** .

--A image of protocol stack should be here

The main advantages of such layering structure is **Conceptualization** and **Structured** , which can solve various problem in communication system , and provide an easy access to make updates.

The main architecture of internet application is divided into `C/S` mode and `peer-to-peer` mode. The `Transport` layer in the protocol stack provide logical communication between different hostsâ€™ application , and TCP protocol and UDP protocol.
