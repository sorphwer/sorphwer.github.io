## T-SQL : Start

### Database Control

Just use `ctrl+N` in SQL server and write code there . You can save it as a isolated `.sql` in a certain path later on,  or it will stay in temp folder.

Basically every script code starts in such structure:

```sql
use master
--Codes here
go
```

**Create a database**:

```sql
use master
create database Databasename
on
  (name= test1_dat,filename='E:\Microsoft SQL Server\database\databasename.mdf') --main file
log on
  (name='databasename_log',filename='E:\Microsoft SQL Server\database\test1log.ldf')--log file
go
```

`Use master` means all commends are under current database.

So you need point out two file at least : main file and its log.

main file must be a `.mdf`  file and it holds everything's location , and log file saves every records in this database. 

However , a database can contains many files attached , whose format is `.ndf`, and they can be saved in a single file or a file group . Besides , you can define more parameters like this:

```sql
use master
go
create database test2
on 
primary

(name=prim_sub1,
filename='E:\Microsoft SQL Server\database\prim_sub1_dat.mdf',--Main file
size = 6mb,
maxsize = 20mb,
filegrowth = 20%),
(name = prim_sub2,
filename='E:\Microsoft SQL Server\database\prim_sub2_dat.ndf',--A sub-file
size = 6mb,
maxsize =20mb,
filegrowth=20%),

filegroup grouptest1  --A group of sub-files , which contains 2 files.
(name = grouptest1,
filename='E:\Microsoft SQL Server\database\group1_sub1_dat.ndf',
size = 6mb,
maxsize =20mb,
filegrowth=5mb),
(name = group1_sub2,
filename='E:\Microsoft SQL Server\database\group1_sub2_dat.ndf',--log file
size = 6mb,
maxsize = 20mb,
filegrowth = 5mb)
go

```

**Detach a database from SQL server**:

If you want to move the database file , or copy/delete its file manually , you shall detach it first. 

And to establish database from file , make attaching on it.

It's easy to remove a database , means your SQL server will no longer recognize it . No file will be deleted during detaching:

```sql
use master
exec sp_detach_db databsename , ture
```

Attaching:

```sql
use master
create database databasename
on(filename = 'PATH') --path of the MAIN FILE
for attach;
go
```

**Create Backup**:

1. Backing up a whole database :

   ```sql
   back up database databasename
     to disk = 'd:\backup\full.bak'
   ```

2. Backing up a whole database :(Rewrite every files)

   ```sql
   back up database databasename
     to disk = 'TARGET PATH' with init
   ```

3. Backing up specific files or filegroups:(Changed file compared with last whole database only)

   ```sql
   back up database databasename
     to disk = 'TARGET PATH' with differential
   ```

4. Creating a backup in many files:

   ```sql
   backup database databasename 
   to disk='d:\backup\part1.bak',disk='d:\backup\part2.bak'
   ```

5. Backing up the log.

   ```sql
   backup log databasename To Disk='PATH'
   ```

   or you can use this to keep complete log info.

   ```sql
   backup log databasename To Disk='PATH' with No_Truncate
   ```
   or if you want to keep tail log:

   ```sql
   backup log databasename To Disk='PATH' with norecovery
   ```

   

**Restore database**:

simple:

```sql
restore database databasename from disk = 'd:\backup\full.bak'
```

**Delete database (Delete file)**:

```sql
use master
drop database databasename
```

### Table Control

Base table is real forms in database.



## T-SQL : Searching

The basic searching code is under such format:

```
select A,B,C,...,Z
from R1,R2,...,Rn
where F
```

which can be transformed into :
$$
\pi_{A_1,A_2,...,A_n}(\sigma_F(R_1*R_2*...*R_m))
$$
Thus ,  `select` means \pi , and where means \sigma.

If there's no limitation , means you want to get all the information from single table ,

please use:

```
select * from TABLENAME 
```

 here , * means no limitation.

 behind `where` you can put bool calculation , and it will select with the answer is true.

 ### Inner function

- `count([distinct|all] expression)`

  Return the number of elements which is not null.

-  `sum(expression)`

  Plus every elements together and return the result.

- `avg(expression)`

  Return the average

- `max()`  and  `min()`

  

 ### Additional commend

 

**order by** :
