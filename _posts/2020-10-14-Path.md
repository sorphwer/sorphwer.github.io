# Path

Generally we use 'path' in web or in file system, to aim a target where we want to navigate.
The format, sometimes is confusing, when we are using changeable `base_url`.

For example, when this jekyll blog runs in local, the `base_url` is `localhost`, while it is `riino.site` now.
In other cases, the situation might be more complex. For example, in dev env, the `base_url` is **example.com**, while in prod env, it become **example.com/welcome!**

When we handle this, the final method is 

```javascript
location.href='example.html' //with history
```

or

```javascript
location.replace('example.html') //without history
```

Of course, we can also use other 'location' to navigate from **different source**:

```javascript
self.location.href;//Current page
window.location.href;//Current page
this.location.href;//Current page
location.href;// Current page
parent.location.href;//Parent page
top.location.href;//Top page       
```

However, how can we manage the **format** of path?
