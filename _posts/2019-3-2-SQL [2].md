# T-SQL : Query under Conditions

## Main Frame

The basic searching code is under such format, A `select` --`from` --`where`  is the most basic  structure in a query.

```sql
select A,B,C,,Z
from R1,R2,...,Rn
where F
```

which can be transformed into :
$$
\pi_{A_1,A_2,\cdots,A_n}(\sigma_F(R_1\times R_2\times \cdots\times R_m))
$$
Thus ,  `select` means $\pi$ , and where means $\sigmaâ€‹$.

If there's no limitation , means you want to get all the information from single table :

```sql
select * from TABLENAME 
```

 here , `*` means no limitation. or you can replace from `distinct` , which means canceling same tuples.

 behind `where` you can put bool calculation , and it will select with the answer is true.

**All in all , the main structure of SELECT Query is :**

```sql
SELECT select_list [INTO new_table]
[FROM table_source] [WHERE search_condition]
[GROUP BY group_by_expression]--Regroup the result by condition, each group generate a single tuple in result table.
[HAVING search_condition]
[ORDER BY order_expression[ASC | DESC]]
```

[Notice] A single select block can be nested for another select block.

 ## Inner function

- `count([distinct|all] expression)`

  Return the number of elements which is not null.

-  `sum(expression)`

  Plus every elements together and return the result.

- `avg(expression)`

  Return the average

- `max()`  and  `min()`
