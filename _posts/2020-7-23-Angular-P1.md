# Introduction

## What’s Angular?

No needs to say more, Angular is one of most mainstream front-end framework, supported by Microsoft and Google. It provides a powerful , standalone constructor with **Typescript**, and because of the language, it does need compiling, while you can still partly cite other framework from a script tag via CDN, like vue.js. 

The biggest difference is that Angular uses TypeScript , and you can’t use JavaScript directly there, unlike other xxx.js module. The reason is that in Angular, there’s a strong OOP pattern, and we will talk about this later.

Unlike Vue.js, you can only work with Angular with CLI, though there’s an online Angular playground(https://stackblitz.com/), but I personally recommend you regard this as a object-oriented language framework, and get yourself ready to make compiling in your machine. 

If want learn Angular, the current official doc is GOOD(https://angular.io/), and the step-by-step demo tutorial is kind.

## TypeScript

You can regard the TypeScript as “Java”, while the JavaScript is the Class file from .java files, which can be executed by JVM (in this case, the browser). And I personally recommend to learn TypeScript from Java’s experience (if you have), rather than JavaScript’s.  Because TypeScript is more like a strongly typed language, while JavaScript, well, a famous, dark, deep weakly typed language. But keep it in mind that **TypeScript is still weakly typed**, remember that in the end, every line of TypeScript will change into JavaScript , right ? So there’s barely no limitation. **But regard it as a strongly typed language is recommended**

TypeScript has many feature that we love to see in Java, like clear types of variable (Literally, though) , **class** , **interface** , **loC**, **DI**....

## Compare with others

Because of TypeScript, Angular asks to regard the project in OOD way, this means you can’t edit your html file and put script, style tags everywhere and play with your DOM with whatever you want. In angular, everything part of a html , should be a **Component**, which is the basic building blocks here, a **Component** should contain a **.ts** file, as the script within, a **.html** file, and a **.css** file as style sheet, and the role connecting html, js(result of compiled ts) and css is in this TypeScript file , rather than html.

In others front-end system, like jinja-driven engine, liquid-driven engine, or thymeleaf , or html+php, the key is to use **embedded syntax** to render data in html, but there’s no limitation in style tag and script tag embedded, which means you can add javascript anywhere, even in Vue.js, you can still add origin javascript to make effects. 

In Angular, the code will be more like those application with windows, like UWP, Java Windows Application (Swing, etc.), even Android development code style. You will have a html as the content, and you have **script  behind**, in each component, this is the most important thought.

# Angular Structure

## The Shell

Generally , to create a blank project, use CLI :

```
ng new app-name
```

And this will generate all the config file and **the shell**, which is located in `app-name\src\app`

In this folder is our shell, which also have a component’s part (all the 4 files with .component): a css file, a html file ,and the script file **behind** the html. Also, there’s a routing script as our **router script**, and a **module config** file.

```
-a----        2020/7/23     21:39            245 app-routing.module.ts
-a----        2020/7/23     21:39              0 app.component.css
-a----        2020/7/23     21:39          25757 app.component.html
-a----        2020/7/23     21:39           1053 app.component.spec.ts
-a----        2020/7/23     21:39            208 app.component.ts
-a----        2020/7/23     21:39            393 app.module.ts
```

In most case this shell will just provide basic view without any JavaScipt, and it’s ready to use router for immediate navigation.

(To know more about shell :https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell)

Thus, a typical shell’s html may be like:

```html
<app-header></app-header>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
<app-footer></app-footer>
```

the **app-header** and **app-footer** means corresponding components.

Then, the router will take over, it will navigate this `router-outlet` tag into other component or , **module**.

Notice that , the router itself is a module, you can guess this from its name, the `app-routing.module.ts` will be like :

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/dashboard', pathMatch: 'full' },
  { path: 'dashboard', component: DashboardComponent },
  { path: 'detail/:id', component: HeroDetailComponent },
  { path: 'heroes', component: HeroesComponent }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [ RouterModule.forRoot(routes) ],
  exports: [ RouterModule ]
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

The content of variable `routes` will config this router’s way of navigation, e.g. if the shell , in some way, change the url into `/dashboard`, then the router will render(actually in TypeScript, implement) a component called `DashboardComponent` to replace `router-outlet` tag, while header and footer won’t be effected.

## Component

The reason why we say a component is “implemented”, is because Typescript regard each component as a **class**, it has a real constructor , and a real init function, you can use `ng generate component dashboard` to generate one, it will create 4 files for you. And the main script file will be like :

```typescript
@Component({ //the annotation confirm what this component should be cited (tag's name), which html/css file it should blind
  selector: 'app-dashboard',
  templateUrl: './dashboard.component.html',
  styleUrls: [ './dashboard.component.css' ]
})
export class DashboardComponent implements OnInit {
  heroes: Hero[] = [];.//here is the member variable of this class

  constructor(private heroService: HeroService) { }//the constructor, the only role is to accept 'DI' target.

  ngOnInit() {
    this.getHeroes();//this is like '$(document).ready(function(){})', here it will run when this class is instantiated.
  }

  getHeroes(): void {//here is the member methord of this class, which is the "script behind", a blinded function's imple in html 
    this.heroService.getHeroes()//see this hereService? it isn't instantiated, because angular use DI to automatically do this.
      .subscribe(heroes => this.heroes = heroes.slice(1, 5));
  }
}
```

## Summary

Now we understand how angular create its template, and how each part of static resource get together.

In next part, we will talk about **how component communicate with others via Services**, and other types of class like **pipe**, also more on **module**, component and module build the backbone of Angular.

Besides, notice that we have a custom class **Hero** , we will also cover this.
