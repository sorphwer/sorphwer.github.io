# Summary of 2020

According to the data from DNS server, there's over `51GB` data delivered via riino.site in 2020, from over `20,000` unique visitors, thanks for you support. In 2020, we released the 3rd re-built version of this blog, and we pushed lots of new features, thanks to everyone who are willing to share their codes. Also, we mentioned the source of them in code comments. In 2021, we will release the first template of this blog.

# New Code color design

We are working on new code color design.

# Custom Banner

We are currently developing custom top panel, with optional config in ymal. This will provide a warning message automatically for those old blogs.

# About 'Lab'

The tag 'Lab' in nav bar is an another independent project of mine, when we release first demo, it will be fully available. Currently We just put an interesting demo made by p5.js there.

# About UI issue in 'Archive'

This will be a low priority issue. We will not fix it in this period.
