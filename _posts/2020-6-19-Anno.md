# New Code color design

We are working on new code color design.

# Custom Banner

We are currently developing custom top panel, with optional config in ymal. This will provide a warning message automatically for those old blogs.

# About 'Lab'

The tag 'Lab' in nav bar is an another independent project of mine, when we release first demo, it will be fully available. Currently We just put an interesting demo made by p5.js there.

# About UI issue in 'Archive'

This will be a low priority issue. We will not fix it in this period.
