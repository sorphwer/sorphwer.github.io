# Panorama

This serious of problems are based on a sorted list (or linked list). Generally we need to make implementation of `insert` `delete elements` and `combine`.

**insert** is quite easy, in list it takes O(n), and in linked list it takes O(1), for example we insert an element in list[P]

```
i = len(list)-1
WHILE i > P
	list[i+1]=list[i] //move the array
	i--
list[i]=list[P]
```

```

```
