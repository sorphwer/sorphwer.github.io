# Why NGRX Store?

In some cases, we need to manage the states inside a component, or even a global state to let our page render corresponding contents for users. NGRX uses `store` to save a current state, and component can get this live state via observeable variables.

Traditionally, we can use a variable as a member inside our component script and make this as a state flag, our code will review this variable and change their state during life cycle. But, to use NGRX can bring such advantages in my opinion:

1. You put state and state-changer, state-handler in an isolated place.
2. You will only have a interface to get/set state.
3. Easier to pass your state, and isolate effect from your pure functions.

To make our code more elegant and replaceable, we can use **facade** pattern based on a `app.facade.ts` , which will provide easy interfaces for components' script to control our **store**. 

# @ngrx/Store

A store is a 'holder' for current state, in our pattern we can use DI to get this store by us DI, and implement store in `app.facade.ts`.

//TODO CODE HERE for constructor

## Component with Store

### Set State

### Get State

## Store-Action-Reducer

## Deep in Store : RxJS 

# @ngrx/Effect
