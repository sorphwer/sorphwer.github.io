# T-SQL : Start

## Database Control

Just use `ctrl+N` in SQL server and write code there . You can save it as a isolated `.sql` in a certain path later on,  or it will stay in temp folder.

Basically every script code starts in such structure:

```sql
use master
--Codes here
go
```

------

### **Create a database**:

```sql
use master
create database Databasename
on
  (name= test1_dat,filename='E:\Microsoft SQL Server\database\databasename.mdf') --main file
log on
  (name='databasename_log',filename='E:\Microsoft SQL Server\database\test1log.ldf')--log file
go
```

`Use master` means all commends are under current database.

So you need point out two file at least : main file and its log.

main file must be a `.mdf`  file and it holds everything's location , and log file saves every records in this database. 

However , a database can contains many files attached , whose format is `.ndf`, and they can be saved in a single file or a file group . Besides , you can define more parameters like this:

```sql
use master
go
create database test2
on 
primary

(name=prim_sub1,
filename='E:\Microsoft SQL Server\database\prim_sub1_dat.mdf',--Main file
size = 6mb,
maxsize = 20mb,
filegrowth = 20%),
(name = prim_sub2,
filename='E:\Microsoft SQL Server\database\prim_sub2_dat.ndf',--A sub-file
size = 6mb,
maxsize =20mb,
filegrowth=20%),

filegroup grouptest1  --A group of sub-files , which contains 2 files.
(name = grouptest1,
filename='E:\Microsoft SQL Server\database\group1_sub1_dat.ndf',
size = 6mb,
maxsize =20mb,
filegrowth=5mb),
(name = group1_sub2,
filename='E:\Microsoft SQL Server\database\group1_sub2_dat.ndf',--log file
size = 6mb,
maxsize = 20mb,
filegrowth = 5mb)
go

```

------

### Detach a database from SQL server:

If you want to move the database file , or copy/delete its file manually , you shall detach it first. 

And to establish database from file , make attaching on it.

It's easy to remove a database , means your SQL server will no longer recognize it . No file will be deleted during detaching:

```sql
use master
exec sp_detach_db databsename , ture
```

Attaching:

```sql
use master
create database databasename
on(filename = 'PATH') --path of the MAIN FILE
for attach;
go
```

------

### **Create Backup**:

1. Backing up a whole database :

   ```sql
   back up database databasename
     to disk = 'd:\backup\full.bak'
   ```

2. Backing up a whole database :(Rewrite every files)

   ```sql
   back up database databasename
     to disk = 'TARGET PATH' with init
   ```

3. Backing up specific files or filegroups:(Changed file compared with last whole database only)

   ```sql
   back up database databasename
     to disk = 'TARGET PATH' with differential
   ```

4. Creating a backup in many files:

   ```sql
   backup database databasename 
   to disk='d:\backup\part1.bak',disk='d:\backup\part2.bak'
   ```

5. Backing up the log.

   ```sql
   backup log databasename To Disk='PATH'
   ```

   or you can use this to keep complete log info.

   ```sql
   backup log databasename To Disk='PATH' with No_Truncate
   ```
   or if you want to keep tail log:

   ```sql
   backup log databasename To Disk='PATH' with norecovery
   ```


------

### **Restore database**:

simple:

```sql
restore database databasename from disk = 'd:\backup\full.bak'
```

---

### **Delete database (Delete file)**:

```sql
use master
drop database databasename
```

## Table Control

### Create Table and Columns

To start editing in a specific database , type `use XXX` to let you know which database will be effected. The format of creating table with its columns is : (for example)

```sql
use databaseneame
create table tablename(
    column1 char(5) not null,
    column2 char(3) null,
    column3 float null,
    primary key (column1),
    foreign key (column2) references tablename2(column2)
)
```

### Add and Alter columns

```sql
use databasename
alter table tablename  --declare which table will be edited
add column5 char(40) not null  --add a new column to table
alter column1 char(40) not null --reset target column , which must exist first.
```

### Delete Table

```sql
use databasename
go
drop table tablename
```

### Insert and Update Data

There’re 3 main measures to inset new data, **Import from .xls file , directly input in SSMS , and use `insert` **

You can directly insert value in the format of tuple.

```sql
use databasename
insert into tablename values('value1','value2','value3',6)
```

When updating data:

```sql
use databasename
update tablename set[column2] = 'NewValue2' where column1 = 'value1'
```

You can remember this line by considering this way:

“update `tablename` set `column to change` = `new value ` where `another column helping` = `another column’s value`”

### Copy Table

```sql
use databasename
select * into table2 from table1 --make a copy named table2 from table1
select * into table3 from table1 where column7 = 'value4' --add a fliter for data to copy.
go
```

### Delete Value

```sql
use databasename
delete from tablename where column7 = 'value4'
go
```



# T-SQL : Query under Conditions

## Main Frame

The basic searching code is under such format, A `select` --`from` --`where`  is the most basic  structure in a query.

```sql
select A,B,C,,Z
from R1,R2,...,Rn
where F
```

which can be transformed into :
$$
\pi_{A_1,A_2,\cdots,A_n}(\sigma_F(R_1\times R_2\times \cdots\times R_m))
$$
Thus ,  `select` means $\pi$ , and where means $\sigma​$.

If there's no limitation , means you want to get all the information from single table :

```sql
select * from TABLENAME 
```

 here , `*` means no limitation. or you can replace from `distinct` , which means canceling same tuples.

 behind `where` you can put bool calculation , and it will select with the answer is true.

**All in all , the main structure of SELECT Query is :**

```sql
SELECT select_list [INTO new_table]
[FROM table_source] [WHERE search_condition]
[GROUP BY group_by_expression]--Regroup the result by condition, each group generate a single tuple in result table.
[HAVING search_condition]
[ORDER BY order_expression[ASC | DESC]]
```



 ## Inner function

- `count([distinct|all] expression)`

  Return the number of elements which is not null.

-  `sum(expression)`

  Plus every elements together and return the result.

- `avg(expression)`

  Return the average

- `max()`  and  `min()`

  

 ## Additional commend

 

**order by** :
