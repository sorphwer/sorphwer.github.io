## Before Math

Assuming all the compile should be involved in `int32` type, which means every returned answer should be limited in [-2^31, 2^31-1]

There’s only two basic calculations : Addition and Subtraction , and three basic bool judgments : ‘More than’ , ‘Less than’ and ‘Equal’, which composed all algorithm next.

## Integer:  Basic Attributes

I personally regard the symbol and the value as two divided attributes in a single integer. Thus, to use  if(int<0) to check whether the integer is negative is quite useful, we can quickly multiply -1 to it , and use another variable to save its symbol. It’s useful when the problem do not care symbol, for example,  Problem  7: Reverse Integer.

We can simply isolate the symbol, do reverse operation in whatever way you like , and reduce symbol:

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x<0:#check negativity
            x=-x
            flag=-1
        else:
            flag=1
        s = str(x)
        s=s[::-1]
        res = int(s)*flag #convert to string and reverse
        if res < -2**31 or res>2**31-1: #check overflow
            return 0
        else:
            return res
```

However, everything above can be represented as 3 lines with totally same thought of solution:

```python
    s = cmp(x, 0)#check negativity
    r = int(`s*x`[::-1])#convert to string and reverse
    return s*r * (r < 2**31)#check overflow

## Integer:  Get Each Number

Some times we need to get each number of a integer, for example (int)1234, we hope we can get 1, 2,3,4 each time, or 4,3,2,1 each time. Next I use Problem 2 : Add Two Numbers as an example.

**Description**

>You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order** and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example**

> ```
> Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
> Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
> Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
> ```

First we talk about having the sum 807, **How do we get each number of this sum and put it in each node of final linked list?**

We can use such scheme: 123% 10 = 3, 123-3 % 100 = 20 , 123 -20 -3 %1000 = 100 . And 3 /1 =3 , 20/10 = 2 , 100/100 = 1. This law can be used in every integer.

Next, **How we assemble a integer by getting single digit each time?** The answer is quite easy: 3x1=3, 2x10=20,1x100=100. 3+20+100 = 123.

Thus the solution is clear:

```python
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        N=0
        N1=0
        N2=0
        while(l1!=None):#get each digit of l1
            N1=N1+l1.val*pow(10,N)
            l1=l1.next
            N=N+1
        N=0
        while(l2!=None):#get each digit of l2 
            N2=N2+l2.val*pow(10,N)
            l2=l2.next
            N=N+1
        Sum=N1+N2 #get plused result
        length=len(str(Sum))#check number of digits to create nodes
        nodes=[]
        i=1
        while(i<=length):
            node=ListNode(int((Sum % pow(10,i))/pow(10,i-1)))#get each digit number of result
            nodes.append(node)
            i=i+1
        for i in range(0,length-1):
            nodes[i].next=nodes[i+1]
        return nodes[0]
```

However, we can plus each list’s unit's digit , ten's digit together at the same time , and put every result in single variable. Moreover, use same loop to put each digit in result linked list , **and use `divmod` to get each number**.

```python
def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        carry = 0;
        res = n = ListNode(0);
        while l1 or l2 or carry:#while carry :check number of digits to create nodes
            if l1:
                carry += l1.val#get each digit of l1 and plus
                l1 = l1.next;
            if l2:
                carry += l2.val;#get each digit of l2 and plus
                l2 = l2.next;
            carry, val = divmod(carry, 10)#get each digit number of result
            n.next = n = ListNode(val);
        return res.next;
```
