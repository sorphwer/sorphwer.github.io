## Thanks!



Thanks for supporting RiinoSite & NoE Blog in these days.<br><br>
2022 is the 10th of this blog project, whose origin name is 'transaction log' in 2012.<br><br>
In early 2015, we published riinosite1.0, which was in wixcom, with fixed template.<br><br>
In 2017,the website was merged into GithubPage. Since then, GithubPage is the first option to deploy riinosite.<br><br>

In 2019, we redesigned entire website from scratch using jekyll, and we drop the origin offcial jekyll template.<br><br>
In 2020, we merged riinosite with website of low illuminance (li.riino.site), and seperated style template, named it as 'jekyll-theme-panda'.<br><br>

Today, we get approximately 4 GB data flow each month, and 'jekyll-theme-panda' has got over 1.9k downloads.<br><br>

We can't got this far without everyone's help, and we want to say thanks to:<br><br>

## Q&A

- *What the next step of this website?*

- Currently there is no plan to rewrite this website using modern framework, but it may happen in riinosite4.0 in the future. Currently we will send tiny update on component like TOC, and fix bug, maintain 3rd dependences. 



- *Backend services?*





- *What about riinosite 4.0?*



- *Cyber security?*
