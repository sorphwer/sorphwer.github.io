### Code's Force

Most contens about codes here are not such ideal to read ,which isn't certain when they becomes "cheat sheet". There're so much content that can't be presented as this blog type, and we may try to discover better way of propagation, and better place to maintain. I'm not such 'geek' man, and am not addicted in components and frames. This site is based on Hux's open template, thanks everyone who creates these attached scripts.Also , all the contents here can be check in [GitHub](<https://github.com/sorphwer>) .
